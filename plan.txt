Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task:

### Plan:

1. **index.php**:
   - Update the save button functionality to change its appearance to a "trashcan" icon with "Un-save" text when a meal is saved.
   - Ensure the rating modal allows users to rate meals from 1 to 5 stars and submit their ratings.
   - Ensure the bookmark button redirects to `calendar.php` with the necessary meal information (e.g., meal ID, name, and instructions).

2. **saveMeal.php**:
   - No changes needed; it already handles saving and un-saving meals correctly.

3. **rateMeal.php**:
   - No changes needed; it already handles rating meals correctly.

4. **bookmarkMeal.php**:
   - Modify the redirection to `calendar.php` to include the meal details (e.g., meal name, instructions) so that it can be added to Google Calendar.

5. **profile.php**:
   - Review and update this file to display saved meals and their ratings, ensuring it integrates well with the new functionalities.

6. **calendar.php**:
   - Update this file to handle the meal data being passed to it for Google Calendar integration.

7. **search.js**:
   - Ensure that any front-end interactions related to the "save", "rate", and "bookmark" buttons are functioning correctly.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Implement the changes in the specified files.
- Test the functionalities to ensure they work as intended.
- Verify that the user experience is smooth and intuitive.
